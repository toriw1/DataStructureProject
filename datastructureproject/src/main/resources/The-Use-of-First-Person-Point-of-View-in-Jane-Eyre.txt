The Use of First Person Point of View in Jane Eyre
        Jane Eyre is a novel about a woman, the titular character Jane Eyre, and her journey through life, told in the first person point of view. The point of view also gives insight into how certain events in Jane’s childhood affect her later in life, because the novel is narrated by Jane later in life. First person point of view is the best option for this novel because the reader is aware of Jane’s thoughts and feelings and can emotionally connect with her. 
        The first part of the novel occurs at Gateshead Hall, where Jane, a penniless orphan, lives with her deceased uncle’s family. The household consists of her aunt, Mrs.Reed, her three cousins, Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed, and the nurse, Bessie. Jane is ten years old at the beginning of the novel and is alienated by almost her entire household, except for Bessie. The novel being told from the first person point of view allows the reader to immediately connect to her feelings of isolation as a result of the abusive treatment she endures from her aunt and cousins.
In the first chapter, Jane says “Me, she had dispensed from joining the group: saying, ‘She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; … she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy little children.’” (Brontë 9). Straight away, the reader is introduced to Jane’s ostracization from her family and her exclusion from the love her cousins are provided with, because she is viewed as inferior to them. This issue causes an immediate connection to Jane because the point of view puts the reader in Jane’s position. Later on in the chapter, the reader is introduced to Jane’s cousins, and is shown the effect of their cruelty on her mind, “He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, … but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.” (Brontë 12). The reader can empathize with Jane because they are aware of her feelings, and the fear she lives with as a result of the continued abuse hurled at her. Later on the same page, Jane states that “Mrs Reed was blind and deaf on the subject” (Brontë 12), the subject referring to John’s malicious attacks towards Jane, which is also indicative of how she is viewed as inferior in her aunt’s mind to her cousins. Later on, Jane is punished for standing up to her cousin's unfair abuse, and the use of point of view in this part both strengthens the reader's emotional connection to Jane, and also creates the dreadful, glum atmosphere present throughout the novel.
        The use of the first person point of view has established an instant emotional connection to Jane, but now it is also used to enhance the atmosphere created by the setting. After Jane is punished for her fight with John Reed, she is sent to the red room, an unoccupied and neglected bedroom which was once inhabited by her deceased uncle. It is revealed that her uncle died in this room, and that her cousins believe it to be haunted. Jane’s young age and perspective add to the cold and haunting atmosphere of this room and allows the reader to be included in on Jane’s feelings of panic and terror. “I thought the swift-darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings: something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I uttered a wild, involuntary cry; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.” (Brontë 21). The descriptions of the room create a frightening atmosphere, which is heightened by Jane’s childish point of view. The reader shares in Jane’s feelings of dread, impending doom, and desperation because of Jane’s naivety, and along with Jane, have a childlike sense of innocence because this is also their first introduction to this room. 
The point of view allows Brontë to add to the creepy atmosphere of the room, making it frightening. Also, because of the point of view, the reader knows that her experience in the red room has a major impact on her throughout her life, much like its impact on the reader throughout the novel, “No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room: it only gave my nerves a shock, of which I feel the reverberation to this day.” (Brontë 25). Being let into Jane’s thoughts, and because Jane herself is narrating the novel, the reader is allowed to know that this incident directly affects Jane for the rest of her life. After this event, Jane is eventually sent to Lowood School, where the next stage of this novel, and her life, takes place. 
        The next part of the novel occurs at Lowood School, a restrictive, repressive institution run by a cruel and domineering headmaster who despises individuality and unrighteous behaviors. It is here where she starts to develop the character traits the reader sees throughout the rest of the novel. The stressful atmosphere of the school causes Jane to rush to emotional maturity. Jane also cultivates her own sense of morality and independence as a result of the oppressive environment. The use of the first person point of view in this section allows the reader to not only experience the harsh reality of Lowood School more personally, it also allows them to see firsthand the start of Jane’s character development. 
        When Jane first arrives at Lowood, she befriends a girl named Helen Burns, who stands out to Jane because of her kindness towards her, which contrasts with how Jane has been treated up until this point, and with the horrible conditions of the school. Helen’s kindness also stands out to the reader because until now, they have been met with abusive, malicious treatment alongside Jane. At first, Jane does not understand Helen’s passive, submissive nature, especially when she is treated cruelly. Helen’s personality is in opposition to Jane at this point, who is headstrong and vocal about wrongdoings committed towards her. Jane herself says “But I feel this, Helen: I must dislike those who  … persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly.” (Brontë 69). The use of first person here allows the reader to have direct access to Jane’s personality traits thus far, and makes her transformation later more impactful. Helen’s ideology has a major influence on Jane’s character growth during her time at Lowood. 
At the end of chapter seven, Jane is humiliated by Mr.Brocklehurst when he publicly punishes her and forbids the rest of the students to speak to her. Initially, Jane is very ashamed and embarrassed, but she turns that shame into strength because of a kind gesture. “ … a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! … I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.” (Brontë 79-80). The reader is told from Jane how this moment has affected her, and can see Jane’s shift in deciding to take her punishment with dignity. This reaction is in opposition with a couple chapters prior, when Jane reciprocates Mrs.Reed’s cruel treatment by lashing out at her vindictively. This moment is the start of Jane’s individual and spiritual development, and progression towards forgiveness. The reader would not be as invested, nor connected with Jane’s journey had this been written in third person point of view because it is Jane’s inner monologue that allows the reader to see the moment of change. Without her inner monologue it would be less impactful. Following this event, a typhus breakout hits Lowood school, and again the use of point of view in this portion reinforces the connection to Jane, as well as supports the grim atmosphere created by the setting. 
During her time at Lowood, many of the students contract Typhus, and the school's atmosphere is drastically changed. While the restrictive environment of the school has lightened, it is set against the heaviness of the disease and death occurring there. Jane’s first hand perspective enables the reader to feel the fear and anxiety she does, and her descriptions add to the gothic undertone of the novel. At one point in the novel, Jane learns that her friend Helen is near death, so she decides one night to sneak out of her room to go see her. “Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings … an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table … my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.” (Brontë 96). The imagery of the dim candle, the white curtains, and the obscured figure creates an eerie and mysterious feel, which is heightened by the point of view. The point of view through Jane’s eyes causes the reader to feel the same fear and anticipation that Jane does, especially because the descriptions lead the reader, along with Jane, to believe they are about to be met with Helen Burns’ corpse. Both the setting, the imagery, and point of view work together to amplify the gothic tone established earlier in the novel. 
In brief, the point of view of Jane Eyre is paramount in telling the story. The point of view used causes the reader to create an emotional connection to Jane. The point of view also works in conjunction with the setting to create the gothic tone of the novel, and conveys it effectively. The first person point of view gives the reader insight into Jane that they otherwise would not have. First person point of view is the best option for this novel.
