The Ike and Tina Turner Revue
I Inducted Musicians - Ike and Tina Turner were a musical duo, and husband and wife, who performed and recorded music together in the sixties and early seventies. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Ike was the guitarist and the leader of the band, and Tina was the lead vocalist. Their crew also consisted of a set of background vocalists called the Ikettes, and a few more instrumentalists, thus forming the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.
II Background - Ike Turner, originally Izear Luster Turner Jr, was born on November 5th, 1931 in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He began playing music during his childhood, starting with the piano. While in high school, he formed a band called the Kings of Rhythm. In 1951, they recorded a song called “Rocket 88”, which reached number one on the Billboard  R&B chart, and is considered by some to be the first rock and roll record. The song was released by Chess Records and ended up being credited to Jackie Brenston & His Delta Cats because Brentson, a saxophonist, provided the lead vocals for the song. Ike switched to playing guitar, and in the mid fifties, moved the Kings of Rhythm to St. Louis, Missouri, where he met Tina Turner.
Tina Turner, née Anna Mae Bullock, was born November 26th, 1939 in Nutbush, Tennessee. She was raised by her grandmother, until she passed away when Tina was 16 years old. She began singing when she was a teenager and eventually, after moving to St. Louis, Missouri to live with her mother, immersed herself in the local rhythm and blues scene. It was during this time, one night while at the Manhattan Club, she heard the Kings of Rhythm, and met Ike Turner. 
She was acquainted with Ike, and soon became a part of the band. This happened after someone else failed to show up for a recording session after they had already booked the studio time. Ike allowed Tina to step in and record a demo of “A Fool in Love”.  Shortly after, in 1960, Ike had Tina change her name from Anna, and renamed the band the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. This is partially because of the advice he had received from Juggy Murray, who at the time was the president of Sue Records. He suggested that he keep Tina’s vocals on the record and make her the star of the band. In 1962, Ike and Tina were married, and they performed together from 1960 to 1976, until she filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. 
III Musical Style - Ike and Tina Turner were known for playing a few different musical styles, mainly rhythm and blues, soul, blues, and rock and roll. They proved themselves to be a powerful force in the soul and R&B music scene. They were also known and lauded for their soul interpretations of rock songs
Ike Turner was known for being a tremendous guitar player and for his infamous reputation as their tyrannical bandleader. Turner had written many of the band's initial hits, but wasn’t known for consistently delivering well-written songs, it was Tina Turner’s vocals that was their real strength, and her presence on stage that really made them something special. 
Tina Turner’s amazing, unique vocal ability and magnetic stage presence was what made them stand out. She was (and still is) an amazing performer and her singing voice is not only impressive, but easily identifiable as well. Her wide vocal range means that she could sing a variety of styles. One unique quality of her voice is how low her voice is, sometimes giving her an androgynous sound. Many have dubbed her the Queen of Rock and Roll because of her power and energy on and off stage. The band’s exciting live performances caused them to grow in popularity, especially in the R&B circuit. As a result of their exuberant performances, they sometimes had trouble reproducing this sound for their records.
IV Principal Works - Ike and Tina Turner recorded many songs, for many different labels over the span of their career together, some of which reached great heights. Although they recorded many songs, for many different labels, they never could reach the success of their original hits with Sue Records. Their first song, “A Fool in Love” was the debut single for their album The Soul of Ike & Tina Turner, and was Tina Turner’s first professional release. The single peaked at number two on the Billboard  R&B chart and even crossed over into the pop charts, peaking at number twenty-seven on the Billboard  Hot 100. After this, they went on a tour to promote the song, which included their first television appearance on American Bandstand. Although the album, which was released by Sue Records in February of 1961, failed to chart, they did have another hit single called “I Idolize You”, which peaked at number five on the Billboard  R&B chart.
        Their next album, Dynamite!, released in May of 1962 also by Sue Records, had massive success with its singles, even earning them their first Grammy nomination. The single, “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine”, peaked at number two on the Billboard  R&B chart and at number fourteen on the Billboard  Hot 100. This would make it their third single to crossover onto the pop charts. It was also nominated for Best Rock & Roll Recording at the Grammys. They would go on to score two more Grammy nominations and win one. In 1975 they were nominated for Best Soul Gospel Performance for their album The Gospel According to Ike and Tina, and in 1972 they were nominated for and won Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group, for their cover of “Proud Mary” by Creedence Clearwater Revival. They also released many other projects, including numerous studio albums, live albums, and even compilation albums of their greatest hits. 
V Legacy - After breaking up in 1976, they both went on to have separate careers. Ike Turner, although made infamous by Tina’s revelations of abusive and controlling behavior, infidelity, prominent drug addiction, and his imprisonment for possession of cocaine, did have a slight comeback in the late 90s. His work has been sampled by numerous artists, including hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa in their song "Shoop", which was released in 1993. The song sampled "I'm Blue (The Gong Gong Song)", which was released by the Ikettes in 1961 and reached number four on the Billboard  Hot 100. Ike also released music of his own, even earning his first solo Grammy win in 2007 for Best Traditional Blues Album, for his album Risin’ with the Blues. He passed away a few months later, on December 12th 2007. 
        Tina Turner’s career only grew after their breakup, making her an icon in her own right. In 1984, she released her first solo album, Private Dancer. The multi-platinum album was a huge success critically and commercially, even earning her 5 Grammy nominations and 3 wins. Most notably, she won Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “What’s Love Got to Do with It”, one of her most well-known songs. She went on to earn 15 more Grammy nominations, including 4 more wins. She has also earned numerous other accolades, and will forever be known as a legendary singer, songwriter, performer, and actress.
